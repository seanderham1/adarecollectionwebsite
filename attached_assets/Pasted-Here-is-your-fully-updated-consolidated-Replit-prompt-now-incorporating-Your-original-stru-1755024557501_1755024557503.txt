# 🧱 FULL REPLIT DEVELOPMENT PROMPT

**Website Project: \[theadarecollection.com]**

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

Create a visually elegant, responsive website using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, hosted on **Replit**, for *The Adare Collection* — a curated portfolio of **exclusive private residences** available for **Ryder Cup 2027** rental on the grounds of **Adare Manor, Ireland**.

The website will:

* **Showcase** ultra-luxury and deluxe properties (2-bed villas to 8-bed mansions)
* **Generate leads**, not sales (no ecommerce)
* Emphasize **location** as the key value (walking distance to the Ryder Cup)
* Offer a **password-protected section** or **sister domain** for VIP-only properties

---

## 🎯 Target Audience

* High-net-worth individuals (HNWIs)
* Corporate sponsors & golf clients
* VIPs & celebrities
* Media teams requiring private & secure accommodation

---

## 🎨 Design & Tone

* Inspired by: [https://www.quintadolago.com/en/](https://www.quintadolago.com/en/)
* Look: Modern, high-end, spacious, visual, with subtle animation
* Feel: Discreet, trusted, service-led, premium
* Color palette: (To be provided — muted, luxury tones)
* Logo: (To be uploaded by user)
* Fonts: Use luxury-styled Google Fonts (e.g., Playfair Display, Lato)

---

## 🧱 SITE STRUCTURE

### 1. **Homepage**

#### 🔥 Hero Section (Video + Map Split)

Split hero layout that immediately showcases location advantage.

**Layout:**

* Left (66.66%): Background video (autoplay, muted, loop)
* Right (33.33%): Interactive map (Google Maps or Mapbox)

  * Golf course & Adare Manor highlighted
  * Clickable property markers
* Entire hero section: Height = 90–100vh
* Responsive: Stack video above map on mobile
* Padding between elements, smooth animation
* Use `object-fit: cover` for video scaling

**Code Implementation Guidance:**
Use Flexbox or CSS Grid with responsiveness in mind. Load map lazily to improve performance. Add accessibility attributes (`aria-label`, fallback `poster`).

#### 💬 Introductory Copy (Under Hero)

> **Welcome to The Adare Collection**
> *Exclusive Private Residences for Ryder Cup 2027*
> As the world turns its attention to Adare Manor, The Adare Collection presents a limited portfolio of refined estate homes — selected for elegance, privacy, and access.
> Each residence is handpicked by **Joe Mulcahy**, a hospitality expert with a 20+ year track record managing VIP stays, events, and premium hosting experiences.

#### 🏘️ Property Grid

* 3x1 responsive grid layout
* Each card:

  * Carousel image
  * Name + property highlights
  * CTA: “Discover More”

### 2. **Property Detail Pages**

(Each property gets its own page in `/pages/`)

**Structure:**

* Features: bedrooms, layout, key amenities
* Gallery (carousel)
* Map section showing walking distance to golf course
* Add-on Services (chauffeur, chef, helicopter)
